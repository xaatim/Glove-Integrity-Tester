# Development Notes - GITS

- Target pressure for testing: 25 kPa (adjustable in code).
- Leak threshold: currently set to 2 kPa drop over 10 seconds.
- Air pump is controlled via L298N to prevent overcurrent.
- Solenoid valve opens after test to release pressure safely.
- LCD displays:
    - Live pressure (kPa)
    - Test status (Inflating / Stabilizing / Testing / Pass / Fail)
- Serial output is enabled for debugging and logging.
- Future consideration: integrate SD card module for data storage.
- Consider replacing the pump with a quieter unit for lab environments.
- ROS2 integration possible for remote control (not implemented yet).
- "designs" folder contains STL files for the chassis and glove adapter.
